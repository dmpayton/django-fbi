# Django Facebook Integration
Facebook integration with Django using the Javascript SDK.

**Built by Derek Payton for [Web Cube CMS][1].**

*Version: 0.1a*

*License: MIT*

*Requirements:*

  - [Django][2] (1.2-ish, untested with 1.1)
  - [python-facebook-sdk][3] (0.1)
  - [django-registration][4] (recent checkout, **not** 0.7 on PyPI)

----------

##Overview

This app was inspired by (and uses a small bit of code from) [django-facebook][5], and aims to be a more pluggable way to integrate with Facebook. Allowing for custom and override-able backends allow you to connect with Facebook on your own terms without having to write everything from scratch.
